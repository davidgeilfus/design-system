{{% lead %}}Prospect.io uses colors purposefully to communicate how things work in the interface and create visual patterns that make interacting with our product easier and more predictable.{{% /lead %}}

## Color Palette

The Prospect.io color palette comes with 8 different hues. Most of them have 3 weights, ranging from 300 (light) to 500 (dark). The gray hue has 7, ranging from 100 (lightest) to 700 (darkest).

## Usage

Colors have a semantic value when used in the interface. Stick with these rules:

- Use green for “Go” actions like “Sign Up,” “Send,” or “Comment”.
- Use red for “Danger” actions like deleting or removing.
- Use yellow for “Waiting” things like loading, warnings, or non-critical errors.
